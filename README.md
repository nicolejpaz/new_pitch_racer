# Pitch Racer

Pit yourself against a friend to see who can sing on key the longest.

Users are presented a note and whoever can sing that note most accurately and the longest "drives" faster. They are presented several notes, one after another, that they must match in order to win.

## To Do:

* Set up microphone capture.
* Match user input (i.e., microphone) to a note on the screen.
* Show multiple notes in a row.
* Have an indication on the screens that shows their accuracy.
* Sync the game with multiple users.
* Allow the user to sing the correct pitch in the octave where they're most comfortable (i.e., a man could sing F3 while a woman could aim for F4). Current range is only between G3 to G4 until this is implemented.
